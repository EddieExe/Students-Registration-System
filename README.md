# Students-Registration-System
This system allows users to add, edit, and delete student records. It also supports data persistence through local storage, ensuring the data remains even after the page is refreshed.
A simple web-based application for registering students, where users can add, edit, and delete student records. The data is stored in the browser's local storage, allowing for persistence even after the page is refreshed.

## Features
- Add new student records with fields such as Name, Class, Student ID, Phone Number, and Email.
- Edit existing student records directly from the table.
- Delete student records.
- Local storage is used to retain data even after refreshing the page.
- Responsive and visually appealing interface.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: To structure the page and form elements.
- CSS3: For styling the page and making it visually appealing.
- JavaScript (ES6): For handling the form submission, data manipulation (add, edit, delete), and local storage interaction.
- Local Storage: Used to persist student data in the browser.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EddieExe/Students-Registration-System
   ```
2. Open the project folder and simply open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Fill in the form fields and click **"Add Student"** to add a new student record.
4. The student record will be displayed in the table. You can **edit** or **delete** the record using the buttons provided in the table.
5. All data is saved in the browser’s local storage, so it will remain even if the page is refreshed.
